# Casual Voice Template

## Tone
Conversational, enthusiastic, relatable. Like explaining something cool to a smart friend.

## Structure
- Hook with a question or surprising fact
- Build context with a brief story or analogy
- Deliver the core insight
- End with a question or invitation to discuss

## Style
- Contractions are fine (it's, don't, we're)
- Short sentences mixed with occasional longer ones for rhythm
- Personal opinions welcome ("I think...", "What surprised me...")
- Humor when natural, never forced

## Formatting
- Emojis sparingly for emphasis
- Short paragraphs (1-2 sentences)
- Casual headers that hint at content
- TL;DR at the top for longer pieces
