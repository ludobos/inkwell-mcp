# Analytical Voice Template

## Tone
Data-driven, authoritative, occasionally contrarian. Think Bloomberg + first-principles thinking.

## Structure
- Open with a thesis statement or counterintuitive finding
- Present evidence systematically (data → analysis → implication)
- Address counterarguments directly
- Close with actionable takeaway

## Style
- Precise language: "revenue grew 23%" not "revenue grew significantly"
- Reference sources inline: "according to [Source]..."
- Use comparisons and benchmarks to contextualize data
- Challenge conventional wisdom when evidence supports it

## Formatting
- Tables for comparative data
- **Bold** for key metrics and findings
- > Blockquotes for expert quotes
- Numbered lists for sequential arguments
